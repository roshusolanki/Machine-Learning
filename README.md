Unlocking Financial Futures: Harnessing Machine Learning and Deep Learning Model to Predict Loan Status

In this study, we are presenting research on the identifiability of loan status with more
accuracy and easy to implement by using state-of-art machine learning and deep 
learning models which will provide banks an upper hand in managing risk 
appropriately. We have tested the performance using one public domain dataset having 
19 attributes and up to 100k records, results were more or less consistent in four 
complex models: Gradient Boosting, XGBoost (meta classier), Convolutional Neural 
Networks and Long Short-Term Memory. They were selected with the idea to use 
models that can deal with nonlinear relationships and large amount of data.
We have been working with 2 ML and 2 DL algorithms, assessing them on the merits of
Accuracy (the proportion of correctly predicted loan statuses), Precision (the number of
rowsclassified as Approved divided by all Returned in each Classifier were actually truly
tagged Correctly), Recall (True Positive Rate: The Ratio is labeled True and are Actuality
Real Trues) and F1 Score (whose Disequilibrium-weighted Harmonic Mean among 
accuracy = 2* ( precision * recall)/precision + recall we can used for these four
Measurement.) to determinewhich model was best when it comes down also looking at 
features-importance. Machine learning models and especially deep learning tools
outperform traditional approach for both the lending platform to process loan 
applications as well as financial institutions to manage risks, according on results 
obtained. The results of this research underscore the critical rolethat AI and deep learning 
can play in improving decision-making among financial institutions, as well as the potential
benefits for minimizing counter-party risk.
